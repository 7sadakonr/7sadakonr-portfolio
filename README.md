## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills in Front-End Development and UI/UX Design.

Built as a Single Page Application (SPA) using **React 19** and **Vite**, the project features a modern "Glass Morphism" aesthetic set against a dynamic, universe-themed background. It emphasizes performance, responsiveness, and interactive user experiences powered by **Three.js** and **GSAP**.

**Live Demo:** [https://7sadakonr-portfolio.vercel.app](https://7sadakonr-portfolio.vercel.app)

## ✨ Key Features

- **Advanced UI/UX:** Translucent Glass Morphism design with a clean, modern interface.
